1. WIKISPECIES PAGERANK:

Information - understand the bigger picture

For this week, you are going to get ready for delivering the homework for the Monday after next, where you are going to find the most popular species on wiki species using the PageRank algorithm
But you are still going to submit homework this week. Just that your results need not be as polished, yet.
Download wikispecies straight from wikimedia or use the compressed XML on blackboard
To do this, you are going to have to mapreduce with the XML data type. Since building hadoop data types is not super easy, I'll give this type to you next week.
Task - due this week - execute and analyze the code for the smaller input file

For now, you can start with the smaller, dataset on blackboard, that is already sharded to be in text format, one line per record
Iterate until you see that the PageRank deltas get smaller, you don't have to converge completely.
If, for some reason, you see junk appearing in the data, get rid of it in your code
Chain your mapreduces with a loop in your driver
